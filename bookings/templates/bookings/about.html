      <p class="my-4 lead">
        Tucked away in the quiet seaside village of Oceanscape,
        <strong>The Cove</strong> is more than just a beach bar, it&#39;s a
        little slice of salt-air serenity, built on a dream (and a fair bit of
        sand in our shoes).<br /><br />
        The idea for The Cove was born one windswept evening when two lifelong
        friends, Ellie and Jack, were watching the tide roll in with fish and
        chips on their laps and a bottle of local cider between them. As the sun
        dipped below the horizon, Jack turned and said, “You know what
        Oceanscape needs? A place where people can sit just like this, but with
        better chairs, better drinks, and maybe a bit of music.”<br /><br />
        That idea turned into scribbles on napkins, long talks by the fire, and
        eventually, a leap of faith. After months of wrangling wood,
        weatherproofing windows, and taste-testing far too many cocktails
        (someone had to do it), <strong>The Cove</strong> opened its doors in
        the summer of 2022.<br /><br />
        We built this place for locals, sea-lovers, walkers, surfers, and anyone
        who needs a breather. Our aim is simple: good food, great drinks,
        friendly faces, and the kind of atmosphere where shoes are optional and
        sunsets are celebrated.<br /><br />
        Everything at The Cove is inspired by the sea, from our seasonal menu
        and beachy cocktails to the driftwood décor and ocean views from every
        table. Whether you&#39;re dropping in for lunch, catching golden hour on
        the terrace, or staying late for live music, you&#39;re always
        welcome.<br /><br />
        So come as you are, bring your sandy feet and salty stories, we
        can&#39;t wait to meet you.
